# Unity-Refraction-Shader

this is just my funny standard shader for unity with refraction capabilities!
its recommended to use the singular refraction compared to multi-refraction! so if you use the multi refraction & have performance problems dont complain that i didnt say not to use it :)

there might be some parts that can be improved upon & if there is PLEASE feel free to reach out and talk with me about it or even suggest shader features that'd be cool to add aswell :3

anyways! hope you enjoy the shader(s) and make some cool stuff with it! this is intended for URP in Unity so idrk if it works on HDRP n such & its VRChat compatible

{Side Note}
-there's alot that i would change and even add BUT i probably wont because well.. im just lazy-
i get bored and work on this every now and again

{things i can but may not change}
- adding a mask to the refraction to prevent bleeding from objects in front so it only refracts the ones behind it properly (this is just a thought currently and may not be added lmao)
- adding joe (would be a great addition)

{what you can do}
- you may edit this shader & even redistribute it but i only ask that you credit me somewhere's in it!
- you can also support my random creations on patreon :) https://www.patreon.com/FreneticFurry
