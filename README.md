# Unity-Refraction-Shader

this is just my funny standard shader for unity with refraction capabilities!
its recommended to use the singular refraction compared to multi-refraction! so if you use the multi refraction & have performance problems dont complain that i didnt say not to use it :)

there might be some parts that can be improved upon & if there is PLEASE feel free to reach out and talk with me about it or even suggest shader features that'd be cool to add aswell :3

anyways! hope you enjoy the shader(s) and make some cool stuff with it! this is intended for URP in Unity so idrk if it works on HDRP n such & its VRChat compatible
